# Arizona

Arizona is a Web Framework for Erlang.

## Project goal

The goal of this project is to have a web framework based on the [Phoenix LiveView](https://hexdocs.pm/phoenix_live_view/Phoenix.LiveView.html), where users connect to the server and send and receive events in realtime via WebSocket.

## Motivation

Phoenix has an important role in the Elixir's popularity and community growth, and when the community grows, the language also grows. Erlang has a wonderful community and a strong and rock-solid structure, but I wanna see Erlang also growing fast and becoming more and more popular to make this world a better and peaceful place. This is the reason and motivation for this project.
